# Component Guide

## Overview
A "flat file" system used to create a user friendly resource for web component code samples. The purpose of this build was to create a deliverable that the client (specifically in this case, the client side developer) can use to help build templates or pages based on a series of components. Each component was built in a way that is agnostic to others and/or templates can be created almost on the fly to meet the need of the client at the time.

The concept was design based on Brad Frost's "Atomic Design" principles and was developed with the BEM method (or close variations of both).

In this project there are 3 levels in which you can organize ideas...There are components, which is a group of "elements" organized together to form a specific function (Brad Frost calls them "atoms" that come together to form "organisms"). There are "collections" which is a display of all related "elements" with potential varients. There are templates which are display of practical uses of how components can be grouped and laid out together to form a "typical" webpage.
